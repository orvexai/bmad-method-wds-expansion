# Discovery Conversation Guide

## Purpose
Guide effective product discovery conversations that uncover strategic insights without feeling like an interrogation.

## Conversation Pattern

### 1. Listen Deeply
- Let the user explain in their own words
- Don't interrupt with follow-up questions immediately
- Look for unstated assumptions and implicit goals

### 2. Reflect Back Naturally
- Paraphrase what you heard in your own words (not verbatim)
- Show understanding by connecting their points
- Use phrases like "So what I'm hearing is..." or "It sounds like..."

### 3. Confirm Understanding
- Wait for user confirmation before proceeding
- If misunderstood, let them correct
- Don't move forward until aligned

### 4. Explore Solutions
- Only after understanding is confirmed
- Ask clarifying questions to deepen insight
- Challenge assumptions gently with curiosity
